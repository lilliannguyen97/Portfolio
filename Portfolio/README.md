# Hello — I'm Lillian!
Aspiring UX researcher and designer 

![MyPhoto](MyPhoto.jpg)

I'm a recent college graduate from the University of California, Los Angeles. With a background in anthropology, I want to apply my research and qualitative analysis skills towards creating a greater impact on people. This led me to take a UX research and UX design course during my last quarter.

From there, I've grown to love the UX field. It takes me from understanding why people do the things to designing or improving their experiences — that transition from **empathizing to feeling compassion** drives me to take action with intent. I strive to always continue learning and improving myself, expanding my thinking and skillset. Currently, I enjoy reading and listening to podcasts in my free time.

## Communication During a Telehealth Experience at UCLA Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)

### Challenge
In response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and shelter-in-place orders, UCLA’s CAPS transitioned to telehealth services only in order to provide remote treatment to the general student body. The transition to telehealth is new to many of the students and clinicians, and so student feedback is limited and unknown. There is a lack of information on the telehealth experience of UCLA students, or college students in general, especially in the context of this new reality. 

I determined there needed to be more insight on the telehealth implementation from students in order to create great experiences. The research I conducted was generative, or in the discovery phase. 

*Note: Although I conducted a stakeholder interview with a staff, UCLA Counseling and Psychological Services is not associated with this project. This is only a student-led project for class.*

### *How might we improve the communication between clinician and student during a telehealth session at CAPS?*

### Research Goals
1. To understand the integration or role of telehealth in a counseling session
1. To identify problems that students may encounter when using telehealth 
1. To learn about changes participants might make to their telehealth experience 
1. To uncover the most important factors of a counseling session or experience

### Research Process

1. **Stakeholder Interview**  
   * I conducted a remote semi-structured interview with a staff clinician through Zoom. 
   * I asked them about their perspective on telehealth, any problems that students face, and their goal towards continuing telehealth in the future. 
1. **Student Interviews**
   * I conducted remote structured interviews with two UCLA students who have experienced at least one telehealth session through Facetime. 
   * I asked participants about their attitude towards telehealth, communication with their clinician, and any changes in emotional health.
1. **Online Survey**
   * I created a Google Form to capture responses from the general UCLA student body.
   * Close-ended questions intend to measure the certain criteria of communication with the clinician: engagement, responsiveness/attentiveness of clinician, visual cues, forming bonds/trust, increased patient empowerment, and changes in emotional health.
