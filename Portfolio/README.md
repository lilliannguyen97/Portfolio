# Hello — I'm Lillian!
Aspiring UX researcher and designer 

[MyPhoto](MyPhoto.jpg)

I'm a recent college graduate from the University of California, Los Angeles. With a background in anthropology, I want to apply my research and qualitative analysis skills towards creating a greater impact on people. This led me to take a UX research and UX design course during my last quarter.

From there, I've grown to love the UX field. It takes me from understanding why people do the things they do to designing or improving their experiences — the transition from empathizing to feeling compassion drives me to take action with intent.
