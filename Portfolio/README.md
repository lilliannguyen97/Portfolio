# Hello — I'm Lillian!
Aspiring UX researcher and designer 

![MyPhoto](MyPhoto.jpg)

I'm a recent college graduate from the University of California, Los Angeles. With a background in anthropology, I want to apply my research and qualitative analysis skills towards creating a greater impact on people. This led me to take a UX research and UX design course during my last quarter.

From there, I've grown to love the UX field. It takes me from understanding why people do the things to designing or improving their experiences — that transition from **empathizing to feeling compassion** drives me to take action with intent. I strive to always continue learning and improving myself, expanding my thinking and skillset. Currently, I enjoy reading and listening to podcasts in my free time. 

## I'd love to speak with you!

## Communication During a Telehealth Experience at UCLA Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)

### Project Overview
In the spring of 2020, I had the opportunity to work on my own UX research project that is related to health technology. I wanted to explore telehealth in a counseling setting since UCLA CAPS was in their early stages of providing remote services to students. 

The research I conducted was generative, or in the discovery phase. 

*Note: Although I conducted a stakeholder interview with a staff, UCLA Counseling and Psychological Services is not associated with this project. This is only a student-led project for class.*

**Research Goals**
1. To understand the integration or role of telehealth in a counseling session
1. To identify problems that students may encounter when using telehealth 
1. To learn about changes participants might make to their telehealth experience 
1. To uncover the most important factors of a counseling session or experience
